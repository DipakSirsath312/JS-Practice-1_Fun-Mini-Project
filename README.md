# JS Practice 1 – Fun Mini Project 🎯

This project is a **JavaScript practice mini project** that demonstrates interactive DOM manipulation and animation using **GSAP**.  
The rectangle dynamically changes its background color based on mouse movement, helping understand real-time event handling and animation logic.

## 📌 Project Description

- A rectangle is displayed at the center of the screen.
- When the mouse moves **from left to right** inside the rectangle:
  - Left side → Color gradually changes to **Red**
  - Right side → Color gradually changes to **Blue**
- When the mouse leaves the rectangle, the color resets to **White**.
- Smooth color transitions are handled using **GSAP animation utilities**.

This project focuses on:
- Mouse events
- DOM manipulation
- Coordinate calculations
- Color mapping logic
- GSAP animations
